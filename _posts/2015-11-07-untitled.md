I decided to try Apple's new [Apple Upgrade]() program for my wife's phone. So one Friday night, we headed over to the Apple store to set it up. My wife picked out the phone, picked out the case, but through the transaction the Apple rep gets a notification that he needs to call and speak with a Verizon "credit analyst". 

At this point, and to this day, I'm lost as to why there's any sort of credit application through Verizon. Apple Upgrade works through Apple and is financially backed by Citizens' Bank. I thought the idea was to skip the cell provider--the middle man so to speak.

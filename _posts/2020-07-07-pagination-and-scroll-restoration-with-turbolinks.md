This solution has issues we try to fix in [part two]({{ site.github.url }}/2020/07/24/pagination-and-scroll-restoration-with-turbolinks-without-cookies/). Still a useful read for context, though.

We've been hearing for a while now that  [HEY](https://hey.com/) would (and did) double down on the frontend architecture Rails and Basecamp are known for -- server-rendered-"HTML-over-the-wire", sprinkles of JavaScript instead of SPA frameworks, no JSON APIs, Turbolinks -- something quite against the grain of "modern" web development.

So shortly after HEY started handing out invitations, JavaScript-Twitter took to...well, Twitter...to [lend](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1274435507317948416) [their](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1275898774422880257) [critiques](https://twitter.com/mahemoff/status/1276673603065442305). Here's one that stuck with me:

The "it" here is restoring scroll position on a paginated, infinite-scrolling list of unread emails.

Rich didn't just say this will be easier in your SPA-framework-of-choice, he said it's "_borderline impossible_" without them. Impossible is a bold claim.

Let's look at how we might do it.

## How to build HEY in 15 minutes with Ruby on Rails

1. First, let Rails write (almost) all the code:

    ```
    $ rails new scratchpad
    $ rails generate scaffold Email subject:string message:string
    ```

2. That will have generated a `test/fixtures/emails.yml` file, change its contents to this:

    ```yml
    <% 100.times do |i| %>
    email_<%= i %>:
      subject: 'Subject #<%= i %>'
      message: 'Message #<%= i %>'
    <% end %>
    ```

3. Run `rails db:fixtures:load` to put some (fake) emails in your inbox.

4. Run `rails server`.

You have an inbox! Unfortunately, it loads all one hundred emails. We'll fix that, but first lets fix restoring our scroll on our inbox.

### Restoring scroll

Right now, if you scroll down in your list of emails, click "show", and then click "back" you're taken to the top of your inbox. Like this:

{:.img-bordered.img-scaled.down-80}
![An Inbox]({{ site.github.url }}/public/images/2020-07-07/no_scroll_preservation.gif)

If we just use the back button, Turbolinks will serve a cached page and restore your scroll automagically ðŸ”® For links in our app, we have to restore the scroll. To do so, we have to 1) capture the scrollbar's position before we leave the page and 2) restore it when we come back to the page. Using Turbolinks, we can use the `turbolinks:before-visit` to fire an event just before we leave a page.

<div class="message">
  <div class="message-body">
That's a bit of an over simplification. `turbolinks:before-visit` is fired just before we leave the page *if we're using Turbolinks to to travel to the next page*. It is possible for you to have links in your application that are purposefully not using Turbolinks, and in that case you'll have to hook into those with a regular click event. But once hooked in, the strategy is the same.
  </div>
</div>

Similarly, Turbolinks gives us a `turbolinks:render` event which fires after Turbolinks has rendered the new page. Using these we have a place to capture the scrollbar's position and restore it.

#### Capturing

```js
Turbolinks.savedScrolls = {}

document.addEventListener("turbolinks:before-visit", function(event) {
  if (document.querySelector("body[data-preserve-scroll=true]")) {
    Turbolinks.savedScrolls = {
      [window.location.href]: {
        document: document.documentElement.scrollTop,
        body: document.body.scrollTop
      }
    }
  }
});
```

`Turbolinks.savedScrolls` is an object that we add to the global `Turbolinks` object. That non-TypeScript JavaScript is so damn flexible! `Turbolinks.savedScrolls` is a hash of saved scroll positions per page that looks like:

```
{ [url]: { document: position, body: position } }
```

We capture both because depending on your styling of `html` and `body`, [you have to](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12788487/document-scrolltop-always-returns-0).

Also, this code lets you opt-in to this functionality on a page-by-page basis. That's what the `if (document.querySelector("body[data-preserve-scroll=true]"))` does. If you don't add that data attribute to your `body` tag, we won't bother preserving the scroll location.

#### Restoring

```js
document.addEventListener("turbolinks:render", function(event) {
  const savedScroll = Turbolinks.savedScrolls[window.location.href]
  if (!savedScroll) { return; }

  delete(Turbolinks.savedScrolls[window.location.href])

  if (savedScroll.document != null) {
    if (savedScroll.document < document.documentElement.scrollHeight) {
      document.documentElement.scrollTop = savedScroll.document
    }
  }

  if (savedScroll.document != null) {
    if (savedScroll.body < document.body.scrollHeight) {
      document.body.scrollTop = savedScroll.body
    }
  }
});
```

Checks if we have a `savedScroll` for this page; if so, grabs it, deletes it from our hash, and sets the appropriate `scrollTops`.

If we weren't paginating anything, that's all it would take!

But we are.

### Pagination

To mimic Hey (and countless other things), we want to implement an infinite-scroll style of pagination. Meaning, instead of clicking a "next" button and navigating to a whole new page of results, we will fetch and display the next page in the background when the user reaches the bottom of the screen.

For example:

{:.img-bordered.img-scaled.down-80}
![Infinite-scroll pagination with a button]({{ site.github.url }}/public/images/2020-07-07/load_more.gif)

<div class="message">
  <div class="message-body">
Or close enough anyway. Instead of loading more when you reach the bottom, we'll just click a button. Because it's simpler.
  </div>
</div>

The tricky part about infinite scrolling is there's no `page` param in the URL, as opposed to something like [https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=2](https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=2), where the `p` in the URL tells the server what page to fetch. So it's on us to keep track of how many pages of emails you should see in your inbox when you navigate back to `/emails`.

There's three different pagination cases we need to handle:

1. The basic pagination case of clicking the "Load More" button where we just fetch the next page of results.

2. The case where you've clicked "Load More" so you have two (or three or four or however many) pages loaded, you click into an email, then come back to your inbox, and we want to remember that you just had two pages loaded.

3. When you do really intend to start over at page one. For us, that's gonna be on a full page refresh.

#### Basic pagination with ~~infinite scroll~~ "load more" button

\#1 and #2 come fairly easily with any pagination library. We'll use [pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy). First, we adjust our `index` action like so:

```rb
class EmailsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @pagy, @emails = pagy(Email.all)
  end
end
```

By default, `pagy` expects `params[:page]` to tell it what page of emails to load, and if it's missing to just load the first.

Next, we'll create a partial for rendering a single email as a row in a table:

```erb
<!-- app/views/emails/_email.html.erb -->

<tr>
  <td><%= email.subject %></td>
  <td><%= email.message %></td>
  <td><%= link_to 'Show', email %></td>
  <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_email_path(email) %></td>
  <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', email, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>
</tr>
```

Now, we'll use that partial in our inbox and add our "Load More" button:

```erb
<!-- app/views/emails/index.html.erb -->

<h1>Emails</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>Message</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <%= render @emails %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<% if @pagy.next %>
  <%= form_with url: emails_path, method: :get do |f| %>

    <%= f.hidden_field :page, value: @pagy.next %>
    <%= f.button "Load More" %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<br>

<%= link_to 'New Email', new_email_path %>
```

One thing to note, our "Load More" button is actually a form. By default, forms in Rails are "remote", meaning Rails automagically submits the form as an AJAX request. What's more, Rails expects and will evaluate JavaScript returned by the server in response to that AJAX form submission. So loading more results happens seamlessly if we add an `app/views/emails/index.js.erb` file like this:


```js
// app/views/emails/index.js.erb

document.querySelector("tbody").
  insertAdjacentHTML(
    'beforeend',
    '<%= j render(partial: "email", collection: @emails) %>'
  );

<% if @pagy.next %>
  document.querySelector("input[name=page]").value = '<%= @pagy.next %>';
<% else %>
  document.querySelector("form").remove();
<% end %>
```

That will find the emails on whatever `page` our form submitted, generate the HTML for that page of emails as a bunch of `tr` elements using our partial, and return the JavaScript needed to append those `tr` elements to our table and ditch the button if there's no more pages.

#### Recovering pages loaded using cookies and headers

Opting to just give it away in the subtitle ðŸ˜¬ But if we're not using the URL, we only have two other options: cookies and headers. We're gonna use both.

Let's start with a monkey patch ðŸ™ˆ

```rb
# config/initializers/monkey_patches.rb

module ActionDispatch
  class Request
    def turbolinks?
      !get_header("HTTP_TURBOLINKS_REFERRER").nil?
    end

    def full_page_refresh?
      !xhr? && !turbolinks?
    end
  end
end
```

`ActionDispatch::Request` ships with an `xhr?` method that checks the value of the `X_REQUESTED_WITH` header to decide if the request is an AJAX (or XMLHttp) request. Importantly, remote forms properly add this header.

We're adding a `turbolinks?` method that also checks a header to decide if this is a Turbolinks-initiated request and a `full_page_refresh?` method.

This allows us to interrogate our request to decide what pagination action we should perform:

| In `Email#index` and         | Then                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `request.xhr?`               | Someone clicked "Load More", give them the JavaScript response that will append the next page of `tr` elements  |
| `request.turbolinks?`        | Someone is coming back to `/emails`, give them all the pages they've requested this session                     |
| `request.full_page_refresh?` | Someone clicked the refresh button, give them just page one                                                     |

For saving which pages we've loaded in the session, let's first look at the API at a high-level:

```rb
class EmailsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @pagy, @emails = paginates(Email.all)
  end
end
```

```rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Pagy::Backend
  include Pagination
end
```

```rb
module Pagination
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  class Paginator; end # redacted the implementation for now

  included do
    before_action { session.delete(:pagination) if request.full_page_refresh? }
  end

  def paginates(collection)
    Paginator.new(self, collection).
      then { |paginator| [paginator.pagy, paginator.items] }
  end
end
```

We've mixed into all our controllers a concern that gives us a new `paginates` method. It's a light wrapper around `pagy` that knows when and how to load any previously loaded pages. The return is the same as `pagy` -- a `Pagy` object that holds some metadata like what the next page is, and a collection of emails.

In the concern, without the details of the `Paginator` class, you'll see two things:

1. `paginates` just punts all the heavy lifting to an instance of `Paginator` that receives the controller object and the collection

2. We setup a `before_action` that clears our session data for pagination whenever our app receives a `full_page_refresh?`

Before we look closer at the `Paginator` class, let's look at the structure of `session[:pagination]`:

```rb
session[:pagination] = {
  "#{controller_name}_#{action_name}" => max_page_param_seen,

  # for example
  "email_index" => 2
}
```

So it's a single session key that we save all of our paginated resources' `max_pages` in, meaning, whenever our app sees a `full_page_refresh` anywhere, we clear them all.

<div class="message">
  <div class="message-body">
By default, the Rails `session` hash is backed by a cookie. We can write like this `session[:pagination] ||= {}` or read like this `session[:pagination][key]`, and just remember that's writing to and reading from a cookie.
  </div>
</div>

Ok, here's the `Paginator` class:

```rb
class Paginator
  attr_reader :controller, :collection, :items, :pagy
  delegate :request, :session, to: :controller

  def initialize(controller, collection)
    @controller = controller
    @collection = collection
    @items = []

    paginate
  end

  private

    def paginate
      if load_just_the_next_page?
        single_page_of_items
      else
        all_previously_loaded_items
      end
    end

    def load_just_the_next_page?
      request.xhr?
    end

    def cache_key
      "#{controller.controller_name}_#{controller.action_name}"
    end

    def session_cache
      if (caches = session[:pagination])
        caches[cache_key]
      end
    end

    def write_to_session_cache(page)
      session[:pagination] ||= {}
      session[:pagination][cache_key] = page
    end

    def max_page_loaded
      [
        controller.send(:pagy_get_vars, collection, {})[:page].try(:to_i),
        session_cache,
        1
      ].compact.max
    end

    def single_page_of_items
      @pagy, @items = controller.send(:pagy, collection).
                                 tap { write_to_session_cache(max_page_loaded) }
    end

    def all_previously_loaded_items
      1.upto(max_page_loaded).each do |page|
        controller.send(:pagy, collection, page: page).
                   then do |(pagy_object, results)|

          @pagy = pagy_object
          @items += results
        end
      end
    end
end
```

That's a lot, but really three main methods -- `paginate`, `single_page_of_items`, and `all_previously_loaded_items` -- and a bunch of helper methods.

`paginate` is responsible for deciding if we need just the requested page or all pages we've seen thus far. `paginate` is called in the initializer. Once initialized, you can use the `Paginator#pagy` method to get the most recent `Pagy` object and `Paginator#items` to get the collection of emails. `items` might be just a page worth emails, or it might be all of the emails we've seen thus far.

`single_page_of_items` does what you might expect, as well as making sure we update our session cookie with the `max_page_loaded`.

`all_previously_loaded_items` retrieves the `max_page_loaded` out of the session and makes sure we load from page one to that page.

### That's it!

With that, it should work! ðŸŽ‰ Here's some interactions I screen grabbed:

### Conclusion

Restoring pagination and scroll position: Is it difficult? Yeah, I'd say so. It at least qualifies as non-trivial.

Is it more difficult than doing the same in React? I don't think so. The logic for "save a scroll position and restore it" is going to be virtually the same. I hear you objecting that we wouldn't have had to store `max_page_loaded` in a cookie with React. Ok sure, but only because you probably took on the much larger task of keeping a cache of your database in Redux or context or local storage or whatever, for which you get zero simplicity points.

Is it impossible? Definitely not.

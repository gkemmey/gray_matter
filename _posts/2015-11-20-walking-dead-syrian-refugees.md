I love "The Walking Dead". I just re-binge watched Seasons 1-5 with my wife, and will probably purchase
Season 6 (I never do that!), because I don't want to wait. And not just because of the countless
Carl! memes, or [my very favorite line in the whole show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJOnLt-rFCI).
I love it because it's deep.

If you look past the zombies, shock-value horror, and the admittedly cheesy way Rick Grimes says
"Carl", "The Walking Dead" has a lot to say about leadership and helping others. If you haven't
yet watched what's on Netflix, you need to go home and rethink your life. Do that now, because

One of the show's main story arcs is Rick Grimes and his leadership role of his family. When we
first meet Rick, he's no nonsense, but compassionate. He knocks a guy out and handcuffs him to a roof
for stirring up trouble (a veritable death sentence) in the second episode, but then goes back
for him, despite voices of dissent, in the third. Later, he rescues a stranger despite 
them shooting at him beforehand. He's a good man, a strong leader, and he tries to preserve the 
ideals of the old world in the nightmare he finds himself in.

Anyway, as time goes on, we watch Rick struggle to balance preserving his ideals and the ideals of
civilization, with the requisites of survival and protecting his family. He goes
from readily rescuing people, to screening people and rescuing only those who respond favorably, to
really not rescuing anyone. Convincingly, I might add. Rick undeniably gets burned; learns lessons
the hard way time and time again. And he comes to this point where he doesn't believe in good people 
anymore. All strangers are enemies until proven otherwise, and proving otherwise is too risky.

Here's where the writers are genius: at no point is it obvious what the right answer is. In fact, 
they purposefully put other leaders like Rick in the show to foil Rick's character and methods. And
the questions of who should be trusted, how do you know, what do you do when you can't tell, are always
there.

So how does this apply? I think like Rick, America is often in a position to help. We're strong,
thriving where others aren't, and we believe in fighting the good fight. Yet we're losing our
capacity to trust. Like Rick, I daresay understandably so. 

We see countless atrocities committed by people with backgrounds similar to the Syrian Refugees. 
These same people profess a hate not only for ideals the American people hold dear, but for America herself, and her citizens. How can we be sure the Refugees don't include some of these people? What
if we can't?

It's scary. I think that's why they call it "terrorism".

As Rick begins to doubt the good in others the show introduces Bob Stookey, ever the optimist. 
Reflecting on the post-apocalyptic world they live in, Bob says to Rick, "Nightmares end. They 
shouldn't end who you are."

Is this not similar? 9/11, the War on Terror, Paris, they are undoubtedly nightmares, but they should
not change who America is, who her people are. We help others because we're strong and we trust in
the good of others. We shouldn't let fear compromise those ideals.

Fear is two things: the mindkiller and [the path to the darkside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnFr-DOPf8).

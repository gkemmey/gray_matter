I haven't quite figured out what I want this to be. A place to improve my writing? Show off somthing I've worked on? Rant about things that are cool? All of the above? I don't know. Guess we'll see what happens.

If you're looking for me in a professional sense, I maintain a personal website [here](http://www.graykemmey.me).
